This repository is a living collection of Windows x64 assembly snippets for hands-on exploration of low-level concepts. It contains minimal, self-contained examplesâ€”NOP sleds, pseudo-random generation, buffer manipulation, XOR encryption, and similar experiments; that are illustrative rather than comprehensive or production-ready. Files will be added and updated over time, so expect the set of examples to grow. Use these snippets for personal experimentation and practice, not as formal educational material or secure production code.
